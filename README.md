About the project: 
This is a website created for a Poet. He wants to show contact information and a few poems to give an idea about his poem's concepts to poetry lovers.
I needed a json file and read more buttons because of multiple and long text blocks of poems. So by loops, we can add poems as much as we want without breaking beauty standarts. 

For a quick overview i attached website and mobile version view of website.
